        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 double pie crust</li>
            <li>8 peaches</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp corn starch</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp heavy cream</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Place a rack in the middle of your oven and preheat to 400Â°F. 
                Moisten your countertop and place a 15x15-inch sheet of parchment paper on it. 
                Dust the parchment paper lightly with flour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the pie dough on the parchment paper and roll it out to 14 inches in diameter. 
                Use a fork to poke a few holes in the center of the dough.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the pie dough on the parchment paper to a sheet pan and chill it in the freezer while you prepare the peaches.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slice the peaches, skin on, into 1/2 inch thick slices. 
                Place the slices in a large bowl and drizzle with vanilla. 
                Mix the sugar and cornstarch, then sprinkle over the peaches.
            </li>
            <li>
                Toss the peaches gently to cover them in the sugar mixture, 
                then place them in a mesh sieve set over the large bowl. 
                Macerate the peaches until they release their juices, about fifteen minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the juices to a small pot set over medium heat and bring to a simmer. Do not stir. 
                Swirl the juices. Once the juices thicken, remove them from the heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the chilled pie dough from the freezer and layer it with the peach slices, 
                working from the center out. Leave a four-inch border. Top the peaches with the cooled caramel.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fold the outer lip of the dough over the peaches, pleating it where necessary. 
                Lightly brush a thin layer of heavy cream onto the top of the galette.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 40 minutes, or until the crust is crispy and golden.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cool the galette on the sheet pan for fifteen minutes before serving. 
                Use the edges of the parchment paper to help you lift it off the sheet pan.

        </ol>
