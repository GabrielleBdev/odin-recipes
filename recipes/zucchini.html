            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated parmesan</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt, divided</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 425ºF. Slice the zucchini into matchsticks 
                that are ½-inch wide and 3-inches long. Set the zucchini aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk the eggs in a bowl. In a separate bowl, stir together the 
                panko, Parmesan, Italian seasoning, and ¼ tsp salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the sliced zucchini to a large bowl. 
                Sprinkle the all-purpose flour and remaining ¼ tsp salt over the zucchini. 
                Toss the zucchini until they are evenly coated in flour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place wire cooling racks over a large baking sheet to lift the zucchini pieces and allow airflow underneath. 
                Bread the zucchini slices by briefly dipping them in the whisked egg, letting the excess run off, 
                then coating them in the panko-Parmesan mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the breaded zucchini on the wire racks with a small amount of space between each piece to allow for airflow.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake the breaded zucchini fries for 20 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve immediately with pizza sauce for dipping.
            </li>
