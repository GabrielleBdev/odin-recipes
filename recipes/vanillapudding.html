            <li>
                Add the sugar and cornstarch to a medium-sized pot. 
                Mix them together and set the pot over medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the milk and stir constantly until it comes to a boil. 
                Continue stirring for 1 minute longer.
            </li>
            <li>
                The milk should be thick enough to coat the back of wooden spoon. 
                Take the mixture off the heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Beat the egg yolks. Whisk one tablespoon of the hot milk into the beaten egg yolks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Continue to whisk in the milk, tablespoon by tablespoon, 
                until the egg mixture is very warm.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set the remaining pot of milk over medium heat and whisk in the warmed egg mixture.
                Bring the pudding to a boil while stirring constantly. 
                Continue stirring for 1 minute longer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Take the pudding off the heat. Add the vanilla and the butter.

                Strain the pudding through a fine mesh sieve.
            </li>
            <li>
